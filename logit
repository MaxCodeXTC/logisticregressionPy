## Setting up our dataframe
Here we'll import a few packages required for this analysis
```{python}
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm
import pylab as pl
import numpy as np
```

We're using a dataset that contains several columns
As predictor variables: 
- gpa  
- gre score  
- rank of an applicant's undergraduate alma mater, to predict if the candidate was admitted or not  

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv("binary.csv")
print(df.head()) 
```

Rename the 'rank' column because there is also a DataFrame method called 'rank'  
```{python}
df.columns = ['admit', 'gre', 'gpa', 'prestige']
print(df.columns) 
```

# Ask pandas to give us a summarized view of our df
# through describe(); Analogous to summary in R.
print(df.describe())

# SD is included in the summary, but we could also
# specifically ask for it using .std()
print(df.std())

# Similar to table() in R, we can use pd.crosstab()
# to get multidimensional frequency table
print(pd.crosstab(
    df['admit'], df['prestige'],
    rownames=['admit']
))
