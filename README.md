# Simple Logistic Regression Tutorial using Python
**Logistic Regression** is a statistical technique capable of predicting a binary outcome and commonly applied in disciplines from credit and finance to medicine and other social sciences.

## Predicting a student's admission rate
A researcher is interested in how variables, such as GRE (Graduate Record Exam scores), GPA (grade point average) and prestige of the undergraduate institution, effect admission into graduate school. The response variable, admit/donâ€™t admit, is a binary variable.

For this tutorial, we will use `pandas`, `statsmodels`, and `numpy` to predict each student's success (admission) rate given their gre, gpa scores and the rank of her alma matter upon application.
